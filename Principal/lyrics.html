        I'm ahead, I'm a man
        I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah
        I'm at peace with my lust
        I can kill 'cause in god I trust, yeah
        It's evolution, baby

        I'm at piece, I'm the man
        Buying stocks on the day of the crash
        On the loose, I'm a truck
        All the rolling hills, I'll flatten 'em out, yeah
        It's herd behavior
        Uh uh
        It's evolution, baby

        Admire me, admire my home
        Admire my son, he's my clone
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
        This land is mine, this land is free
        I'll do what I want but irresponsibly
        It's evolution, baby
        I'm a thief, I'm a liar
        There's my church, I sing in the choir:
        (Hallelujah, hallelujah)
        Admire me, admire my home
        Admire my son, admire my clones
        'Cause we know
        Appetite for a nightly feast
        Those ignorant Indians got nothin' on me
        Nothin', why?
        Because it's evolution, baby!
        I am ahead, I am advanced
        I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah
        I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher
        Twenty Ten, watch it go to fire
        It's evolution, baby
        It's evolution, baby
        Do the evolution
        Come on
        Come on, come on
